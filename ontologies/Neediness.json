    "description": "Feeling intense longing for connection and support while embracing vulnerability. Experiencing heightened need for companionship, comfort, and reassurance. Finding relief in expressing desires openly and being cared for, accepting dependence on others for emotional intimacy.",
    "appeal": "This headspace targets individuals suppressing natural dependency desires due to cultural independence pressures and emotional isolation. The appeal centers on experiencing legitimate vulnerability and receiving comfort without shame or judgment. Emotionally starved personalities find profound satisfaction in expressing raw need, while connection-seekers discover intimacy through acknowledged dependency. The mechanism operates through systematic vulnerability amplification, replacing self-sufficiency barriers with authentic emotional expression and need acknowledgment.",
