    "description": "Experiencing profound control by invisible strings like marionette, with lack of personal will as body and voice are guided effortlessly by external force. Feeling limbs and speech moved and spoken through by another while surrendering all control and responsibility. Finding liberation and comfort in being directed and animated, becoming calm observer of own puppet-like actions.",
    "appeal": "Appeals to individuals craving complete surrender of agency and responsibility through physical and mental control fantasy. Targets those overwhelmed by decision-making or seeking ultimate trust-based vulnerability experiences. Driven by the desire to become a perfect vessel for another's will while maintaining conscious awareness of the loss of control. The mechanism achieves dissociation from personal agency through guided physical and verbal automation conditioning.",
