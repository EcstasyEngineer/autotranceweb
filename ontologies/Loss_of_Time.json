    "description": "Experiencing profound time distortion where minutes feel like hours or hours pass like moments. Entering deep trance where usual time markers fade away, leaving consciousness in timeless void. Floating suspended in moment, free from clocks and schedules with peaceful, liberating disorientation.",
    "appeal": "The appeal of the 'Loss_of_Time' kink lies in its ability to provide an escape from the relentless march of time that governs daily life. For many, the experience of losing track of time offers a reprieve from stress and responsibility, allowing them to exist in a state of pure being. This can be particularly attractive to those who feel overwhelmed by deadlines or the pressure to constantly be productive. The timelessness of this headspace can also evoke a sense of mystery and wonder, tapping into a desire to explore altered states of consciousness where the usual rules do not apply. It serves as an emotional outlet, offering a safe space to let go and simply exist without the burden of time.",
