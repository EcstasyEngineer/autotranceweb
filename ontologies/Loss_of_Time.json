    "description": "Experiencing profound time distortion where minutes feel like hours or hours pass like moments. Entering deep trance where usual time markers fade away, leaving consciousness in timeless void. Floating suspended in moment, free from clocks and schedules with peaceful, liberating disorientation.",
    "appeal": "This theme attracts individuals overwhelmed by time pressure and deadline anxiety seeking temporal liberation. The appeal centers on experiencing freedom from chronological constraints and productivity demands. Triggers include desires for timeless states, escape from scheduling stress, and deep immersive experiences. The mechanism disrupts temporal awareness through dissociative techniques that create subjective time distortion and present-moment absorption.",
