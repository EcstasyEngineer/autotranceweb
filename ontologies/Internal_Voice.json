Feeling calm clarity as burdens of self-doubt and overthinking lift away. Finding comforting presence within mind or reveling in peaceful quiet, achieving heightened focus and tranquility.",
    "appeal": "This theme targets individuals overwhelmed by self-critical internal dialogue and decision-making anxiety. The appeal drives from replacing harsh self-judgment with supportive guidance or peaceful mental silence.

The mechanism works by restructuring internal narratives, either introducing dominant guidance voices or creating meditative mental quiet that reduces cognitive burden.",
