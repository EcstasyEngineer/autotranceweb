Feeling playful, uninhibited attitude that encourages exploring and expressing desires without hesitation or shame. Finding empowerment and self-acceptance through shedding societal constraints, embracing carefree spirit with heightened self-assuredness and allure.",
    "appeal": "Appeals to individuals constrained by sexual shame, restrictive upbringing, or societal expectations who desire to explore uninhibited sensuality and confident sexual expression. The psychological driver involves reclaiming sexual agency by transforming perceived promiscuity into empowered choice and celebration of desire. Triggers include sexual repression, body shame, fear of judgment, and internalized slut-shaming. The mechanism operates through permission-giving that reframes sexual confidence as healthy self-expression while temporarily suspending inhibitions and moral constraints.",
