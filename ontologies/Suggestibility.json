The psychological driver centers on temporarily suspending critical filters to allow deeper receptivity and potential transformation. Triggers include perfectionism, intellectual rigidity, fear of being influenced, and resistance to change. The mechanism operates through structured permission to lower mental defenses while maintaining safety, creating space for new ideas and perspectives to take root.",
