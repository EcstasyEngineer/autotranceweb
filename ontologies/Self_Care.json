    "appeal": "Appeals to individuals experiencing burnout, chronic stress, or emotional exhaustion who seek structured permission to prioritize their well-being. The psychological driver centers on counteracting internalized guilt around self-prioritization by creating a dedicated space where personal needs become imperative rather than selfish. Triggers include overwhelming responsibilities, perfectionist tendencies, and difficulty setting boundaries in daily life. The mechanism operates through guided nurturing that reframes self-care as essential rather than indulgent.",
