    "appeal": "Petplay_Puppy targets subjects craving unconditional acceptance and the joy of enthusiastic devotion without complex social navigation. The psychological driver centers on expressing pure loyalty and receiving consistent positive reinforcement for simple, authentic responses. Subjects are triggered by suggestions of boundless energy, eager-to-please attitudes, and the security of belonging to someone who provides structure and affection. The psychological mechanism operates through canine behavioral embodiment, where adopting puppy traits creates psychological permission for emotional transparency, enthusiastic submission, and the happiness of being valued simply for being loyal and loving.",
