    "description": "Experiencing profound shift away from human identity with emotions, autonomy, and personal traits minimized or stripped away. Feeling objectification like inanimate object or tool, existing solely for use or pleasure of another. Finding calm detachment as thoughts and emotions become muted, embracing simpler mechanical existence as vessel for another's will.",
    "appeal": "The appeal of dehumanization lies in its ability to provide a stark contrast to the complexities and responsibilities of everyday life. For some, the idea of relinquishing control and becoming an object of use can be deeply freeing, offering a respite from the pressures of decision-making and emotional engagement. This headspace allows individuals to explore themes of powerlessness and objectification in a controlled and consensual environment, often serving as an emotional outlet for those who find comfort in surrendering their autonomy. The experience can be cathartic, providing a unique form of escapism where the subject can temporarily shed their human burdens and embrace a simpler, more directed existence.",
