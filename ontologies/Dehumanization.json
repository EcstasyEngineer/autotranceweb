    "description": "Experiencing profound shift away from human identity with emotions, autonomy, and personal traits minimized or stripped away. Feeling objectification like inanimate object or tool, existing solely for use or pleasure of another. Finding calm detachment as thoughts and emotions become muted, embracing simpler mechanical existence as vessel for another's will.",
    "appeal": "This headspace attracts individuals seeking escape from the overwhelming complexity of human decision-making and emotional burdens. The appeal centers on transformative relief from self-consciousness and personal responsibility, replaced by the serene simplicity of becoming an object without needs or desires. Participants crave the profound stillness that emerges when identity dissolves into pure utility. The psychological mechanism operates through systematic dismantling of ego-driven concerns, creating space for mechanical compliance and purposeful existence.",
