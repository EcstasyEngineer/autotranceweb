    "description": "Becoming enveloped in whirlwind of overwhelming sensory input that is both exhilarating and disorienting. Experiencing rush of adrenaline as senses are bombarded with intense lights, sounds, and scents creating thrilling chaos. Surrendering to sensory storm where perception blurs and overload washes away conscious thought, leaving only raw sensation.",
    "appeal": "Overload targets subjects whose nervous systems crave intense stimulation to break through habitual numbness and cognitive rigidity. The psychological driver centers on overwhelming the conscious mind's filtering mechanisms to access deeper, more instinctual response patterns. Subjects are triggered by escalating sensory bombardment that progressively dissolves analytical thinking until only raw sensation remains. The psychological mechanism operates through controlled overwhelm, where excessive input creates a state of productive confusion that bypasses normal mental defenses and allows direct access to primal response systems.",
