    "appeal": "Appeals to individuals seeking escape from decision fatigue and the burden of self-determination by finding purpose through absolute devotion to another. The psychological driver involves transforming personal agency into structured service, where worth derives from perfect obedience rather than independent achievement. Triggers include overwhelming life choices, imposter syndrome, and deep-seated need for external validation. The mechanism creates psychological safety through total surrender of responsibility while maintaining dignity through the elevation of service to sacred duty.",
