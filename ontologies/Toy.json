    "description": "Experiencing profound sense of being object designed for use, devoid of personal agency or decision-making. Feeling deep immersion of being acted upon, manipulated, or played with like doll or puppet. Finding surrender and acceptance with comforting detachment from responsibility, becoming attuned to sensations without burden of choice.",
    "appeal": "Attracts individuals seeking relief from constant self-advocacy and decision fatigue through complete objectification. Appeals to those who find validation in being desired purely for physical form and utility rather than personality or achievements. The dynamic removes the burden of agency and choice, allowing subjects to exist solely for others' pleasure and manipulation. This mechanism transforms subjects into responsive objects that derive satisfaction from being handled, used, and appreciated for their compliance.",
