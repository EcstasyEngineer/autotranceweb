    "description": "Drifting into deep, enveloping sleep where consciousness gently fades away. Mind descending into peaceful abyss as thoughts become whispers and body feels weightless. Finding sanctuary in timeless detachment, wrapped in warm safety while surrendering to restorative unconsciousness.",
    "appeal": "Appeals to individuals struggling with insomnia, racing thoughts, or inability to mentally disconnect from daily stressors who crave guided surrender into restorative unconsciousness. The psychological driver centers on transforming sleep from an elusive goal into an inevitable outcome through structured relaxation and mental release. Triggers include chronic overstimulation, anxiety-driven hypervigilance, and difficulty with traditional sleep hygiene. The mechanism operates through progressive relaxation combined with permission to fully disengage from conscious control.",
