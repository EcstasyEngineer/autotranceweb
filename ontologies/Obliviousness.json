    "description": "Experiencing profound sense of not noticing or understanding surroundings, wrapped in soft, comforting fog that blurs awareness. Feeling gentle detachment from environment with muted emotions and serene acceptance of incomprehension. Drifting into peaceful, oblivious state where only singular directed focus matters.",
    "appeal": "Obliviousness targets subjects who are overwhelmed by constant hyperawareness and decision fatigue in their daily lives. The psychological driver centers on the relief from cognitive burden and the exhaustion that comes from perpetual vigilance. Subjects are triggered by guided instructions that systematically reduce awareness while maintaining core safety mechanisms. The psychological mechanism operates through controlled dissociation, where consciousness narrows to a blissful fog that filters out unnecessary stimuli while preserving essential responsiveness.",
