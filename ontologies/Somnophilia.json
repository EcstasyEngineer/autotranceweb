    "description": "Experiencing deep relaxation and vulnerability on edge of sleep, letting go of conscious control into semi-aware dreamlike state. Feeling heightened sensitivity to touch and sound where every sensation becomes amplified yet soothing. Finding trust and surrender in safe space while floating in warm, comforting environment free from burdens and responsibility.",
    "appeal": "Appeals to individuals who find arousal in the liminal space between consciousness and sleep, where vulnerability becomes profound trust and control dissolves into pure sensation. The psychological driver centers on the ultimate surrender of agency while maintaining connection through heightened physical sensitivity. Triggers include desire for complete vulnerability, fascination with altered consciousness, and need to relinquish all control. The mechanism operates through the paradox of feeling both completely helpless and perfectly safe, creating intense intimacy through consensual powerlessness.",
