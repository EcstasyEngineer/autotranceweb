    "description": "Experiencing profound dissolution of personal identity, merging into state of oneness with universe through weightlessness and timelessness. Feeling individual thoughts and concerns dissolving into vast ocean of collective consciousness with fluid emotions. Finding serene acceptance of impermanence and interconnectedness, discovering liberation through deep peace and unity while surrendering to universal flow.",
    "appeal": "This state attracts individuals exhausted by constant self-monitoring and the relentless pressure of maintaining individual identity in an increasingly fragmented world. The appeal lies in profound liberation from ego-driven concerns, replacing anxious self-awareness with expansive consciousness that transcends personal boundaries. Participants seek the transformative peace of dissolving into universal flow, discovering freedom from the prison of separate selfhood. The psychological mechanism operates through systematic dissolution of identity barriers, creating space for oceanic consciousness where individual suffering merges into collective transcendence.",
