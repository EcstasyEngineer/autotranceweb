    "description": "Being consumed by intense, overwhelming cravings that drive every thought and action. Feeling deep, insatiable need creating cycles of longing and temporary fulfillment. Experiencing the emotional highs of indulgence and tension of dependency as desires become all-controlling.",
    "appeal": "People drawn to this theme often struggle with decision fatigue and the overwhelming burden of constant choice in modern life. Their core need involves experiencing the relief of having desires simplified into singular, consuming focus that eliminates mental complexity. Effective triggers center on words that intensify craving and create urgency around specific desires or behaviors. The theme works by hijacking natural reward pathways and creating artificial dependency loops that provide psychological relief through focused obsession.",
