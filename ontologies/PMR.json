    "description": "Experiencing profound journey into relaxation through systematic muscle tension and release cycles. Feeling calm surrender as tension melts away and soothing waves of relaxation replace stress and worries. Floating like on gentle sea with light body and free mind, fostering deep safety and comfort.",
    "appeal": "PMR targets subjects carrying chronic muscular tension and stress-induced physical rigidity from demanding lifestyles. The psychological driver centers on the systematic release of held patterns through methodical body awareness and conscious relaxation. Subjects are triggered by structured guidance that creates contrast between tension and release, amplifying the pleasure of letting go. The psychological mechanism operates through progressive somatic awareness, where focused attention on muscle groups creates a cascade of relaxation that spreads throughout the nervous system and induces profound calm.",
