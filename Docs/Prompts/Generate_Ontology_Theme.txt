# Ontology Theme Generation Prompt

You are tasked with generating a complete ontology JSON file for a hypnokink theme. Given only the theme name, you must create all required sections following the exact format and style established.

## INPUT
- Theme name (e.g., "Vulnerable", "Appetite", "Confidence")

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate a complete JSON file with these exact keys:

```json
{
    "description": "[description text]",
    "appeal": "[appeal text]", 
    "keywords": [array of keywords],
    "tags": [array of tags],
    "cnc": boolean
}
```

## DESCRIPTION SECTION
Generate 2-3 sentences following this exact pattern:

1. **Start with action words**: "Experiencing", "Feeling", "Finding", "Becoming", "Embodying"
2. **Focus on the experience**: What the person feels, not how it works
3. **Present tense, active voice**: Direct experiential statements
4. **No explanatory language**: Avoid "This state is", "The process involves", "Induction begins"
5. **Concrete sensations**: Physical and emotional experiences

**Good examples:**
- "Experiencing profound control and mastery over desires with calm, focused mindset empowered to make conscious choices."
- "Feeling transformative self-assurance and empowerment with warm, glowing sensation spreading from core."
- "Finding deep purpose and joy in uplifting others through inspiring cheerleader spirit."

**Avoid:**
- "The [Theme] headspace is..."
- "This state is characterized by..."
- "Induction involves..."
- Lengthy explanatory paragraphs

## APPEAL SECTION  
Write from a **script writer's perspective** - what would someone writing hypnosis content need to understand about why people are drawn to this theme?

Focus on:
- **Psychological drivers**: What deep needs does this fulfill?
- **Contrast dynamics**: How does this differ from daily life?
- **Writer insights**: What emotional buttons to press?
- **Target audience psychology**: Who seeks this and why?

Keep it practical and analytical, not academic or verbose.

## KEYWORDS SECTION
Generate 15-20 keywords that function as **embedded commands** and **hypnotic motifs**.

These should be:
- **Repeatable phrases** that can be woven throughout scripts
- **Emotionally charged words** that trigger the desired state
- **Action-oriented terms** that suggest behaviors/feelings
- **Hypnotic language patterns** that reinforce the theme
- **Single words or short phrases** (max 2-3 words)

**Good examples for "Confidence":**
- "self-assurance", "empowerment", "radiance", "inner conviction", "poise"

**Good examples for "Vulnerable":**  
- "openness", "authenticity", "safe space", "emotional release", "tenderness"

Avoid abstract concepts - focus on words that create visceral responses.

## TAGS SECTION
Select 2-4 tags from these categories:
- **Behavior**: Actions, habits, lifestyle changes
- **D/s**: Power dynamics, submission, dominance
- **Experience**: Sensations, states, feelings  
- **Hypnosis**: Trance states, mental phenomena
- **Identity**: Role-play, persona adoption
- **Personality**: Character traits, mindsets
- **Meta**: Self-referential, about the process itself

## CNC FIELD
Set to `true` only if the theme involves:
- Consent erosion or resistance play
- Non-consensual elements as fantasy
- Themes that push consent boundaries

Most themes should be `false`.

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

```json
{
    "description": "Experiencing transformative self-assurance and empowerment with warm, glowing sensation spreading from core and filling with radiant energy. Feeling thrill of accomplishment and certainty of capabilities through affirmations and visualizations of success. Behaving with poise and decisiveness, unburdened by doubt with inner conviction, purpose, and clarity.",
    "appeal": "Writers should understand that confidence themes tap into the universal struggle with self-doubt that most people face daily. The appeal lies in temporary relief from imposter syndrome and social anxiety. Target audience seeks transformation from insecurity to empowerment. Key psychological drivers include desire for social validation, fear of judgment, and need for internal strength. Scripts should emphasize contrast between current self-doubt and future self-assured state, using visualization and affirmation techniques.",
