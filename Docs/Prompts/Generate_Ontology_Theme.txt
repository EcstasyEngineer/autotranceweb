# Ontology Theme Generation Prompt

You are tasked with generating a complete ontology JSON file for a hypnokink theme. Given only the theme name, you must create all required sections following the exact format and style established.

## INPUT
- Theme name (e.g., "Vulnerable", "Appetite", "Confidence")

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Generate a complete JSON file with these exact keys:

```json
{
    "description": "[description text]",
    "appeal": "[appeal text]", 
    "keywords": [array of keywords],
    "tags": [array of tags],
    "cnc": boolean
}
```

## DESCRIPTION SECTION
Generate 2-3 sentences following this exact pattern:

1. **Start with action words**: "Experiencing", "Feeling", "Finding", "Becoming", "Embodying"
2. **Focus on the experience**: What the person feels, not how it works
3. **Present tense, active voice**: Direct experiential statements
4. **No explanatory language**: Avoid "This state is", "The process involves", "Induction begins"
5. **Concrete sensations**: Physical and emotional experiences

**Good examples:**
- "Experiencing profound control and mastery over desires with calm, focused mindset empowered to make conscious choices."
- "Feeling transformative self-assurance and empowerment with warm, glowing sensation spreading from core."
- "Finding deep purpose and joy in uplifting others through inspiring cheerleader spirit."

**Avoid:**
- "The [Theme] headspace is..."
- "This state is characterized by..."
- "Induction involves..."
- Lengthy explanatory paragraphs

## APPEAL SECTION  
Write as direct psychological insights about the theme that enable better script creation.

Structure (3-4 sentences total):
1. **Target audience psychology**: Who seeks this content and their core struggles
2. **Psychological drivers**: What deep needs this fulfills and why it works
3. **Emotional triggers**: Key psychological buttons and effective approaches
4. **Practical dynamics**: What makes this theme compelling vs daily life

Write in present tense, analytical tone. Avoid "writers should" or meta-commentary about writing. Focus on pure psychological insights that inform content creation.

## KEYWORDS SECTION
Generate 15-20 keywords that function as **embedded commands** and **hypnotic motifs**.

These should be:
- **Repeatable phrases** that can be woven throughout scripts
- **Emotionally charged words** that trigger the desired state
- **Action-oriented terms** that suggest behaviors/feelings
- **Hypnotic language patterns** that reinforce the theme
- **Single words or short phrases** (max 2-3 words)

**Good examples for "Confidence":**
- "self-assurance", "empowerment", "radiance", "inner conviction", "poise"

**Good examples for "Vulnerable":**  
- "openness", "authenticity", "safe space", "emotional release", "tenderness"

Avoid abstract concepts - focus on words that create visceral responses.

## TAGS SECTION
Select 2-4 tags from these categories:
- **Behavior**: Actions, habits, lifestyle changes
- **D/s**: Power dynamics, submission, dominance
- **Experience**: Sensations, states, feelings  
- **Hypnosis**: Trance states, mental phenomena
- **Identity**: Role-play, persona adoption
- **Personality**: Character traits, mindsets
- **Meta**: Self-referential, about the process itself

## CNC FIELD
Set to `true` only if the theme involves:
- Consent erosion or resistance play
- Non-consensual elements as fantasy
- Themes that push consent boundaries

Most themes should be `false`.

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

```json
{
    "description": "Experiencing transformative self-assurance and empowerment with warm, glowing sensation spreading from core and filling with radiant energy. Feeling thrill of accomplishment and certainty of capabilities through affirmations and visualizations of success. Behaving with poise and decisiveness, unburdened by doubt with inner conviction, purpose, and clarity.",
    "appeal": "Confidence themes attract individuals struggling with imposter syndrome, social anxiety, and chronic self-doubt in daily life. Core psychological drivers include desperate need for internal validation, fear of judgment, and exhaustion from constant self-criticism. Most effective triggers emphasize transformation from current insecurity to future empowerment through visualization and affirmation. Theme works by providing temporary relief from perfectionism while building new neural pathways of self-assurance.",
