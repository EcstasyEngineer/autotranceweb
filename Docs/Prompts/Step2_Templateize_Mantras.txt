# Step 2: Convert to Template Format with Cross-Theme Tagging

Convert the provided mantras to template format with variable substitution and cross-theme analysis.

## Conversion Rules

### 1. Variable Substitution
- "I" → "{subject_subjective}"
- "my" → "{subject_possessive}" 
- "me" → "{subject_objective}"
- "Master" → "{dominant_name}"
- "Master's" → "{dominant_name}'s"

### 2. Verb Conjugation
Add brackets when verb follows subject: "feel" → "[feel|feels]"
Examples:
- "I feel" → "{subject_subjective} [feel|feels]"
- "I become" → "{subject_subjective} [become|becomes]"
- "I trust" → "{subject_subjective} [trust|trusts]"

### 3. Cross-Theme Detection
Tag mantras that reference concepts from other themes:
- **Trust/Faith** → [Trust]
- **Submission/Obedience** → [Submission,Obedience] 
- **Mind/Thoughts** → [Mindlessness,Suggestibility]
- **Control/Power** → [Brainwashing,Control]
- **Transformation/Change** → [Ego_Loss,Transformation]

## Output Format
DIFFICULTY[TAB]TEMPLATE[TAB]DOM/NODOM[TAB]CROSS_THEMES

Where:
- DOM: References {dominant_name}/Master
- NODOM: No dominant references
- CROSS_THEMES: [Theme1,Theme2] or [] if none

## Examples

INPUT:
BASIC: I accept new ideas with an open mind.
LIGHT: I feel peaceful when Master guides me.
MODERATE: My mind becomes soft and receptive.

OUTPUT:
BASIC	{subject_subjective} [accept|accepts] new ideas with an open mind.	NODOM	[Openness]
